# backstage_location (Data Source)

Use this data source to get a specific [Location entity](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/descriptor-format#kind-location) from Backstage Software Catalog.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Retrieves specific location data:
data "backstage_location" "example" {
  # Required name of the location:
  name = "example-location"
  # If not provided, namespace defaults to "default" or the the one set in the provider:
  namespace = "example-namespace"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the entity.

### Optional

- `fallback` (Attributes) A complete replica of the `Location` as it would exist in backstage. Set this to provide a fallback in case the Backstage instance is not functioning, is down, or is unrealiable. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--fallback))
- `namespace` (String) Namespace that the entity belongs to.

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String) Version of specification format for this particular entity that this is written against.
- `id` (String) A globally unique ID for the entity. This field can not be set by the user at creation time, and the server will reject an attempt to do so. The field will be populated in read operations.
- `kind` (String) The high level entity type being described.
- `metadata` (Attributes) Metadata fields common to all versions/kinds of entity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metadata))
- `relations` (Attributes List) Relations that this entity has with other entities (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--relations))
- `spec` (Attributes) The specification data describing the entity itself. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))

### Nested Schema for `fallback.metadata`

Optional:

This field can not be set by the user at creation time, and the server will reject an attempt to do so. The field will be populated in read operations.The field can (optionally) be specified when performing update or delete operations, and the server will then reject the operation if it does not match the current stored value.
- `labels` (Map of String) Key/Value pairs of identifying information attached to the entity.
- `links` (Attributes List) A list of external hyperlinks related to the entity. Links can provide additional contextual information that may be located outside of Backstage itself. For example, an admin dashboard or external CMS page. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--fallback--metadata--links))
- `name` (String) Name of the entity.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace that the entity belongs to.
- `tags` (List of String) A list of single-valued strings, to for example classify catalog entities in various ways.
- `title` (String) A display name of the entity, to be presented in user interfaces instead of the name property, when available.
- `uid` (String) A globally unique ID for the entity. This field can not be set by the user at creation time, and the server will reject an attempt to do so. The field will be populated in read operations.
